## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Notes

It was a bit confusing to follow the documentation since it is for a previous version of Swift. However, with a little more research on the changes and their correspondence to the previous version has helped to finish creating the demo. Also, it would be great to have more guidelines on optional parts of the demo to have a clearer idea of what is expected!
